        <h2>About MediaBox</h2>
        <p>Welcome to MediaBox! This site is essentially a software to listen to your media collection from anywhere using just a browser, without having to install any other software on your computer. To avoid copyright issues, the content on this site is essentially private, a <a href="{% url 'explore_public' '' %}">public area</a> exists for demonstration purposes only.</p>

    <div class="span4">
        <h2>About the media player</h2>
        <p>The site uses the <a href="http://webplayer.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Web Player</a> to play music files in your browser. It's not great, because it uses Flash, so you need to have the Flash plugin correctly installed in your browser. If you know a good alternative implemented in pure HTML5 please let me know and I'll be happy to change it.</p>

        <p>If you have been invited, you can login to the <a href="{% url 'explore_private' '' %}">private area</a> using <a href="http://openid.net/what/">OpenID</a>. You do not need a password for this site itself, and your email password never passes through this site.</p>

        <h2>The future of this site</h2>
        <p>I use this site every day to listen to my favourite music while doing boring tasks that don't need much attention. I occasionally add new features to make it easier to use. If you have suggestions, or discover problems that should be fixed, do let me know.</p>

        <h2>Having <em>your own</em> MediaBox</h2>
        <p>Obviously our taste of music is different. If you want to have your very own MediaBox, you can! This software is open-source, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/janosgyerik/mediabox">GitHub</a> and install on your own server. If you need help setting it up I'll be happy to help, just ask!</p>
